## Deploying a Google ADK-Based Agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine (2025)

The following instructions are based on the very latest documentation and best practices for deploying a Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) agent to Google Vertex AI Agent Engine as of June 2025. The steps have been reviewed for accuracy and completeness, and sample code is provided where relevant[1].

---

**I. Prerequisites & Environment Setup**

- Create or select a Google Cloud project.
- Enable billing and the Vertex AI API.
- Install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI:
  ```bash
  gcloud components update
  gcloud auth login
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
- Install Python dependencies (Python 3.9–3.12 supported):
  ```bash
  pip install google-adk google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]
  ```

---

**II. Project Structure**

Your directory should look like:
```
parent_folder/
└── weather_app/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── agent.py
```
- Ensure `__init__.py` contains: `from . import agent`[1].

---

**III. Configuration Files**

- In `weather_app/.env`, set:
  ```dotenv
  GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=YOUR_CLOUD_LOCATION
  ```
  Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_CLOUD_LOCATION` (e.g., `us-central1`)[1].

---

**IV. Deployment Script (`deploy_to_agent_engine.py`)**

Place this script in your `parent_folder/`. This script initializes Vertex AI, wraps your agent, and deploys it to Agent Engine. Replace placeholders with your actual values.

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai import agent_engines
from vertexai.preview import reasoning_engines
from weather_app.agent import root_agent

PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
LOCATION = "YOUR_CLOUD_LOCATION"
STAGING_BUCKET = "gs://YOUR_STAGING_BUCKET_NAME"

print(f"Initializing Vertex AI for project '{PROJECT_ID}' in location '{LOCATION}'...")
vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION, staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET)
print("Vertex AI initialized successfully.")

app = reasoning_engines.AdkApp(
    agent=root_agent,
    enable_tracing=True,
)
print(f"ADK App created for agent '{root_agent.name}'.")

print("Deploying agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine. This may take a few minutes...")
remote_app = agent_engines.create(
    agent_engine=app,
    requirements=[
        "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]",
    ]
)
print("Agent deployment initiated successfully.")
print(f"Deployed Agent Engine resource name: {remote_app.resource_name}")

# Optional: Test remote interaction
REMOTE_USER_ID = "test_user_remote"
remote_session = remote_app.create_session(user_id=REMOTE_USER_ID)
print(f"Remote session created (ID: {remote_session['id']}).")

for event in remote_app.stream_query(
    user_id=REMOTE_USER_ID,
    session_id=remote_session["id"],
    message="What is the weather in New York?",
):
    print(event)
```
- Make sure the `STAGING_BUCKET` exists and is accessible.

---

**V. Running the Deployment**

- In your terminal:
  ```bash
  cd parent_folder
  python deploy_to_agent_engine.py
  ```
- The script will print the `resource_name` of your deployed agent. Deployment may take several minutes[1].

---

**VI. Interacting with the Deployed Agent**

- Use the `remote_app` object in your script to create sessions and send queries, as shown in the sample code above[1].

---

**VII. Clean Up**

To avoid unexpected costs, delete the deployed agent when finished. Uncomment and use the cleanup code in your script:
```python
# if 'remote_app' in locals() and remote_app.resource_name:
#     remote_app.delete(force=True)
```
Or run a separate cleanup script[1].

---

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly.
- The staging bucket must exist and be in the same region as your deployment.
- Use the correct Python version (3.9–3.12).
- Make sure you have the required IAM permissions for deploying and managing Vertex AI resources.
- If you encounter permission or API errors, verify your authentication and project configuration.

| Step                | Description                                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prerequisites       | Cloud project, billing, Vertex AI API, CLI, Python, dependencies |
| Structure           | `weather_app/` with `agent.py` and `__init__.py`                |
| Configuration       | `.env` with project and location                                 |
| Deployment Script   | `deploy_to_agent_engine.py` with sample code above               |
| Run Deployment      | `python deploy_to_agent_engine.py`                               |
| Interact            | Use `remote_app` for queries                                     |
| Clean Up            | Use `.delete(force=True)` to remove agent                       |
