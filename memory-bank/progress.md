[2025-06-13 22:15:32] - ## 2025-06-13: Project Progress

### Completed
1. Set up root_agent package structure
2. Implemented agent with weather and time tools
3. Successfully deployed agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine
   - Resource Name: projects/845122974817/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/6480583106762899456

### Current Status
- Agent is deployed and running
- Client script (query_weather.py) needs to be updated with new agent resource name

### Next Steps
1. Update query_weather.py with new agent information
2. Test agent functionality with client script
3. Document any issues or improvements needed

[2025-06-13 23:06:12] - ## 2025-06-13: query.py Update

### Completed
1.  Updated `query.py` to accept full natural language queries as command-line arguments (e.g., `python query.py "what is the weather in toronto"`).
2.  The script now passes the user's full query directly to the deployed agent.
3.  Tested and confirmed working for weather-related queries.

## Task: Refactor `get_weather` function (Completed)

[2025-06-14 17:45:40] - 
**Refactoring `get_weather` in `root_agent/agent.py` (Completed 2025-06-14):**

*   **Objective:** Refactor the `get_weather` function to use the live OpenWeather API instead of hardcoded responses.
*   **Key Steps & Outcomes:**
    1.  **Planning:** Developed a detailed plan covering API key management, function logic, error handling, dependencies, and testing strategy. (Plan saved to `decisionLog.md`)
    2.  **API Key Setup:** Securely stored the OpenWeather API key in `root_agent/.env` and updated `.gitignore`.
    3.  **Dependencies:** Added `requests` and `python-dotenv` to `requirements.txt` and installed them.
    4.  **Function Refactoring:** Modified `root_agent/agent.py` to implement the `get_weather` function using the OpenWeather API, including robust error handling for various scenarios (network issues, API errors, bad responses).
    5.  **Unit Testing:** Created `root_agent/test_agent.py` with a comprehensive suite of unit tests using `unittest.mock` to simulate API interactions. All unit tests passed after initial debugging.
    6.  **Live Environment Debugging:**
        *   Encountered an issue during `adk run root_agent` where the API key was initially invalid (401 error).
        *   Temporarily added `print` statements to `get_weather` for live debugging.
        *   Successfully diagnosed the API key issue; user updated the key.
        *   Resolved subsequent syntax errors and an accidental deletion of `get_current_time` that occurred during debug cleanup.
    7.  **Final Cleanup:** Removed all temporary debugging statements from `root_agent/agent.py`.
*   **Result:** The `get_weather` function is now fully refactored, robustly tested, and confirmed to be working correctly with the live OpenWeather API when run via `adk run root_agent`.
